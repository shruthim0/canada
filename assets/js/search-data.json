Ride preference—denotes whether a patron prefers roller coasters, other thrill rides, gentle rides, or no rides. | B. Walking preference—denotes how far a patron is willing to walk in between rides. | C. Food preference—denotes the type of food that a patron prefers to eat (e.g., chicken, burgers, salads). | D.

It would allow the user to gather data without taxing the computer’s hardware. | B. It would allow the user to see the effect of specific variables by ensuring that the others do not change. | C.

Which of the following statements describes a limitation of using a computer simulation to model a real-world object or system? . A. Computer simulations can only be built afer the real-world object or system has been created. | B. Computer simulations only run on very powerful computers that are not available to the general public. | C.
