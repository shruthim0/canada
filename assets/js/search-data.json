            "content": "Plans for Project . These are the main things we need to keep in mind and follow as a group to meet the expectations for the project and be successful. | . Roles for Project . Possible Future Site . What are simulations by College Board definition? . Simulations are abstractions that mimic more complex objects or phenomena from the real world Purposes include drawing inferences without the contraints of the real world | . | Simulations use varying sets of values to reflect the changing state of a real phenomenon | Often, when developing a simulation, it is necessary to remove specific details or simplify aspects Simulations can often contain bias based on which details or real-world elements were included/excluded | . | Simulations allow the formulation of hypotheses under consideration | Variability and randomness of the world is considered using random number generators | Examples: rolling dice, spinners, molecular models, analyze chemicals/reactions... | . Functions that are often needed . import random # a module that defines a series of functions for generating or manipulating random integers random.choice() #returns a randomly selected element from the specified sequence random.choice(mylist) # returns random value from list random.randint(0,10) #randomly selects an integer from given range; range in this case is from 0 to 10 random.random() #will generate a random float between 0.0 to 1. . Examples of College Board MC Simulation Questions . Question: The following code simulates the feeding of 4 fish in an aquarium while the owner is on a 5-day trip: . numFish ← 4 . foodPerDay ← 20 . foodLeft ← 160 . daysStarving ← 0 . REPEAT 5 TIMES { foodConsumed ← numFish * foodPerDay foodLeft ← foodLeft - foodConsumed IF (foodLeft &lt; 0) { daysStarving ← daysStarving + 1 } . } . This simulation simplifies a real-world scenario into something that can be modeled in code and executed on a computer. | . Simulation Code Starters . Pull random card from a deck . Additions we would make to this include: Visual of the card chosen | User can choose how many cards should be chosen | . | . import random cards = [&quot;Ace&quot;, &quot;2&quot;, &quot;3&quot;, &quot;4&quot;, &quot;5&quot;, &quot;6&quot;, &quot;7&quot;, &quot;8&quot;, &quot;9&quot;, &quot;10&quot;, &quot;Jack&quot;, &quot;Queen&quot;, &quot;King&quot;] suits = [&quot;Diamonds&quot;, &quot;Hearts&quot;, &quot;Spades&quot;, &quot;Clubs&quot;] print(random.choice(cards) + &quot; of &quot; + random.choice(suits)) . 2 of Clubs . Frog jumping . Additions Again, add visuals of the frog | Add more variables to make this more realistic Weather: If the weather is worse&gt; frog should jump less | Time: If it is day time &gt; frog should jump less | ^ These could be user inputs | . | . | . import random length = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5] direction = [&quot;left&quot;, &quot;right&quot;] print(&quot;The frog jumped&quot; , random.choice(length) , &quot;hops to the&quot; , random.choice(direction)) . The frog jumped 5 hops to the left . Population after natural disaster . When natural disasters occur, certain times random traits are wiped from a population Take for example the Galapagos finches When a drought hit, smaller seeds became more rare so finches with larger beaks had greater chance of survival | this can be modeled (with lots of simplification) | . | . | Additions we would add specific data on beak size/wing length/height so for certain disaster, wing legnths &gt; 5.5 survived | . | . | . import random beak = [&quot;small-beak&quot;, &quot;long-beak&quot;, &quot;medium-beak&quot;], wing = [&quot;small-wings&quot;, &quot;large-wings&quot;, &quot;medium-wings&quot;], height = [&quot;short&quot;, &quot;tall&quot;,&quot;medium&quot;] naturaldisaster = [&quot;flood&quot;, &quot;drought&quot;, &quot;fire&quot;, &quot;hurricane&quot;, &quot;dustbowl&quot;] print(&quot;When a&quot; , random.choice(naturaldisaster) , &quot;hit&quot;, random.choice(height), &quot;birds died&quot;) . When a drought hit short birds died .",
