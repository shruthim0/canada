Simulations are abstractions that mimic more complex objects or phenomena from the real world Purposes include drawing inferences without the contraints of the real world | . | Simulations use varying sets of values to reflect the changing state of a real phenomenon | Often, when developing a simulation, it is necessary to remove specific details or simplify aspects Simulations can often contain bias based on which details or real-world elements were included/excluded | . | Simulations allow the formulation of hypotheses under consideration | Variability and randomness of the world is considered using random number generators | Examples: rolling dice, spinners, molecular models, analyze chemicals/reactions... | . import random # a module that defines a series of functions for generating or manipulating random integers random.choice() #returns a randomly selected element from the specified sequence random.choice(mylist) # returns random value from list random.randint(0,10) #randomly selects an integer from given range; range in this case is from 0 to 10 random.random() #will generate a random float between 0.0 to 1. . Examples of College Board MC Simulation Questions . Question: The following code simulates the feeding of 4 fish in an aquarium while the owner is on a 5-day trip: . numFish ← 4 . foodPerDay ← 20 . foodLeft ← 160 . daysStarving ← 0 . REPEAT 5 TIMES { foodConsumed ← numFish * foodPerDay foodLeft ← foodLeft - foodConsumed IF (foodLeft &lt; 0) { daysStarving ← daysStarving + 1 } . } . This simulation simplifies a real-world scenario into something that can be modeled in code and executed on a computer. | . Simulation Code Starters . Simple coin flip . Additions we would make to this include: Instead of outputs being &quot;heads/tails&quot; program would output 5 pictures showing the coin orientation | User can choose how many coins they want to flip | . | . import random def coinflip(): #def function randomflip = random.randint(0, 1) #picks either 0 or 1 randomly (50/50 chance of either) if randomflip == 0: #assigning 0 to be heads--&gt; if 0 is chosen then it will print, &quot;Heads&quot; print(&quot;Heads&quot;) else: if randomflip == 1: #assigning 1 to be tails--&gt; if 1 is chosen then it will print, &quot;Tails&quot; print(&quot;Tails&quot;) #Tossing the coin 5 times: t1 = coinflip() t2 = coinflip() t3 = coinflip() t4 = coinflip() t5 = coinflip() . Heads Heads Tails Tails Heads . Pull random card from a deck . Additions we would make to this include: Visual of the card chosen | User can choose how many cards should be chosen | . | . import random cards = [&quot;Ace&quot;, &quot;2&quot;, &quot;3&quot;, &quot;4&quot;, &quot;5&quot;, &quot;6&quot;, &quot;7&quot;, &quot;8&quot;, &quot;9&quot;, &quot;10&quot;, &quot;Jack&quot;, &quot;Queen&quot;, &quot;King&quot;] suits = [&quot;Diamonds&quot;, &quot;Hearts&quot;, &quot;Spades&quot;, &quot;Clubs&quot;] print(random.choice(cards) + &quot; of &quot; + random.choice(suits)) . 2 of Clubs . Frog jumping . Additions Again, add visuals of the frog | Add more variables to make this more realistic Weather: If the weather is worse&gt; frog should jump less | Time: If it is day time &gt; frog should jump less | ^ These could be user inputs | . | . | . import random length = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] direction = [&quot;left&quot;, &quot;right&quot;] print(&quot;The frog jumped&quot; , random.choice(length) , &quot;hops to the&quot; , random.choice(direction)) . The frog jumped 5 hops to the left .",
