    "## What are simulations by College Board definition?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Simulations are abstractions that mimic more complex objects or phenomena from the real world\n",
    "    - Purposes include drawing inferences without the contraints of the real world\n",
    "- Simulations use varying sets of values to reflect the changing state of a real phenomenon\n",
    "- Often, when developing a simulation, it is necessary to remove specific details or simplify aspects\n",
    "    - Simulations can often contain bias based on which details or real-world elements were included/excluded\n",
    "- Simulations allow the formulation of hypotheses under consideration\n",
    "- Variability and randomness of the world is considered using random number generators\n",
    "- Examples: rolling dice, spinners, molecular models, analyze chemicals/reactions..."
