    "**A theme park wants to create a simulation to determine how long it should expect the wait time at its most popular ride. Which of the following characteristics for the virtual patrons would be most useful? Select two answers**\n",
    "\n",
    "- A. Ride preference—denotes whether a patron prefers roller coasters, other thrill rides, gentle rides, or no rides.\n",
    "- B. Walking preference—denotes how far a patron is willing to walk in between rides.\n",
    "- C. Food preference—denotes the type of food that a patron prefers to eat (e.g., chicken, burgers, salads).\n",
    "- D. Ticket type—denotes whether the patron has a single-day pass, a multi-day pass, or an annual pass.\n",

A scientist created a simulation of the hole in the layer using a computer, which models the growth of the hole over many years. Which of the following could be useful information that the simulation could produce?**\n",
