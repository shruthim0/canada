    "Loops in SASS are a powerful feature that allows the repetition of CSS code with different values. There are two types of loops in SASS: @for and @each. The @for loop is used to generate a set of CSS rules based on a range of numbers or a list. The @each loop, on the other hand, is used to loop through a list or a map. Loops in SASS can be used to generate a series of CSS rules based on different conditions or to create a set of variations on a specific style. They can also be used to simplify code and reduce repetition."

    "Functions in SASS are a way to encapsulate a piece of code that can be reused throughout a SASS stylesheet. SASS has many built-in functions, such as color manipulation functions, mathematical functions, string functions, and list functions. Functions can be called using the function name and passing in any required arguments. The returned value can be assigned to a variable or used directly in a property value. They can be useful in many scenarios, such as calculating complex values, generating CSS values based on input, or simplifying repetitive code. They can also be combined with other SASS features, such as mixins and control directives, to create more powerful and flexible code."
