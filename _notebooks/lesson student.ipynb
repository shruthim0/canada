    "- A database model shows the logical structue of a database\n",
    "- It fundamentally determines in which manner data can be stored, organized, and manipulatied\n",
    "- Some popular database models are relational models, object oriented models, hierarchial models, flat file models, and network models\n",
    "- The one below is an Object-Relational Model which is a combination of a relational model and an object oriented model"

The base64 bytes are then encoded into a python literal string in order to be jsonified and displayed on the api endpoint.

    "The lesson for time and space complexity of algorithms will consist of demonstrations of sorting algorithms and the different time complexities that they come with on a small scale. This can be acomplished using things such as a deck of cards or even with actual people. An example of how this will work is laying out the cards in a random order on the table, and demonstrating different ways of sorting it. From methods such as bubble sort to methods such as bogo sort, it will be really easy to see exactly how much time it would take for these different sorting algoritms to complete. Then after that, it is easy to understand the concept of time complexity when given a real world example.\n",

    "Our quickSort algorithm consists of 2 procedures, a `partition()` procedure that **pivots** and sorts individual elements, and a `qSortUserList()` that performs recursion which finishes the sorting.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Logic\n",
    "The partition procedure will serve to \"partition\" our list into 2 parts, a smaller portion and a larger portion around a certain pivot value (Note: These portions don't have to sorted yet!). \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Partition procedure\n",
    "First, partition selects a certain element in a list to be a pivot. This pivot value will be used to make comparisons to every other value in the array. For simplicity, we have selected our pivot element as the last element in the unsorted list. The procedure defines a `pivot_pos` variable to denote the correct position of the pivot index after each iteration. Although it may seem weird that the variable intially starts with a value of 0-1 = -1, this negative index is resolved by the return statement, which always returns an index that's one higher than pivot_pos. This serves to ensure that the lowest pivot index would be 0, which is the smallest element in any given partition. \n",
    "```python\n",
    "pivot = arr[hi][1]\n",
    "pivot_pos = lo - 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "The partition will then iterate over each element in the list from the starting and ending indexes indicated by the parameters. if a particular value is found to be larger than the pivot, the algorithm well then increment the recorded pivot position and swap the pivot with the found element. \n",
    "```python\n",
    "for idx in range(lo, hi):\n",
    "    if arr[idx][1] >= pivot:\n",
    "        pivot_pos+=1\n",
    "        arr[pivot_pos], arr[idx] = arr[idx], arr[pivot_pos]\n",
    "```\n",
    "Finally, the partition procedure swaps the element at the `pivot_pos+1` index with our pivot element at the `hi` index to place the pivot at it's rightful place. We know that `pivot_pos+1` must be smaller than `hi` because it did not trigger the conditional to increment the `pivot_pos+1`` index. At last, the pivot_pos is incremented and returned to serve as an indicator of where our two partitions split.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "arr[pivot_pos + 1], arr[hi] = arr[hi], arr[pivot_pos + 1]\n",
    "return pivot_pos+1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### qSort procedure\n",
    "If the parition procedure splits our list into smaller and larger regions, then our qSort procedure ensures that these regions are in order. It's hard to explain, but the procedure iterates over each paritition, repeating the paritition process, setting new pivot values, and correctly places the pivot values at their correct sorted order.\n",
    "\n",
    "The procedure first checks if the lower index is smaller than the higher index, to ensure that our parition has a length greater than 1. If this check passes, the procedure then calls the `partition` procedure to both split our list into the two distinct regions and also the index of our correctly placed pivot value. The procedure then invokes itself again on the larger interval (replacing hi to be the partition index-1 since the previous pivot is already sorted), and also on the smaller interval (replacing lo to be partition index+1).\n",
    "\n",
    "Eventually, the qSort procedure will iterate through all elements in the list while parition places each element at the correct position, giving us the final sorted list. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Complexity analysis\n",
    "To analyze time complexity, we must analyze the partition and qSort procedures.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the qSort procedure, because we divide the array into 2 halves during each function call, our number of function calls scales proportionally to , where n is the length of the input array. However, within each function call, we also call the partition procedure, which contains an for-loop that iterates over each element in the partioned array, comparing it to a pivot value. We are well familiar with since loops, and can safely say that runtime scales proportionally to the length of the partition array. Due to this, we can conclude that our iteration time complexity scales linearly. Thus for each iterative process, our timerun scales proportionally to n. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we could multiply our two complexities together to get a representation of our overall complexity. Thus, the asymptotic notation for a time complexity could be represented as O(nlogn), where n is the length of the input array. Keep in mind, Big-Oh notation is not a function that returns the accurate runtime for any given input, but rather only gives us a model to see how runtime scales with increasing input sizes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Space complexity for this program is much easier to analyze. Because the array is sorted in-place (meaning we don't create other placeholders or copies), we require no additional space to sort this array. However, recursive function calls may require extra storage on the call stack. Since we found the number of recursive calls to be asymptotic to O(logn), we can conclude that quickSort has an **O(1)** space complexity for an iterative method, and an **O(logn)** space complexity for a recursive method.\n",

    "\n",
    "On this notebook, try recreating the original quicksort algorithm from our modified version. For an additional challenge, try abstracting the partitioning process through list comprehension!\n",

    "After creating a successful algorithm, either create a diagram showing how the algorithm works, or a diagram that illustrates the time and/or space complexity of a recursive approach.\n",
