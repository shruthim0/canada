Generally speaking, a Python object is an entity of data items and methods describing the behavior of those items.\n",

Using the same recipe (class), we can create many cakes (objects). This is the essence of creating a class in Python: to define data elements and the rules establishing how these elements can interact and change their state â€” and then use this framework to build various objects in a set way, instead of creating them from scratch every time.\n",
