    "1. A researcher gathers data about the effect of Advanced Placement®︎ classes on students' success in college and career, and develops a simulation to show how a sequence of AP classes affect a hypothetical student's pathway.Several school administrators are concerned that the simulation contains bias favoring high-income students, however.\n",
    "    - answer options:\n",
    "        1. The simulation is an abstraction and therefore cannot contain any bias\n",
    "        2. The simulation may accidentally contain bias due to the exclusion of details.\n",
    "        3. If the simulation is found to contain bias, then it is not possible to remove the bias from the simulation.\n",

It then lets him choose different future scenarios, such as having children. For each scenario chosen, the tool does some calculations and outputs his projected savings at the ages of 35, 45, and 55.Would that be considered a simulation and why?\n",

    "        1. The simulation will not contain any bias that favors one body type over another, while an experiment will be biased.\n",
