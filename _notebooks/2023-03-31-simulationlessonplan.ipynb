    "## What are simulations by College Board definition?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Simulations are abstractions that mimic more complex objects or phenomena from the real world\n",
    "    - Purposes include drawing inferences without the contraints of the real world\n",
    "- Simulations use varying sets of values to reflect the changing state of a real phenomenon\n",
    "- Often, when developing a simulation, it is necessary to remove specific details or simplify aspects\n",
    "    - Simulations can often contain bias based on which details or real-world elements were included/excluded\n",
    "- Simulations allow the formulation of hypotheses under consideration\n",
    "- Variability and randomness of the world is considered using random number generators\n",
    "- Examples: rolling dice, spinners, molecular models, analyze chemicals/reactions...\n",
    "\n",
    "## Simulation vs. Experiment\n",
    "- **Experiment** definition: procedure undertaken to make a discovery, test a hypothesis, or demonstrate a known fact\n",
    "\n",
    "So, why use a simulation?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Advantages**: \n",
    "    - Can be safer\n",
    "    - More cost-effective\n",
    "    - More efficient \n",
    "    - More data in less time\n",
    "- **Disadvantages**:\n",
    "    - Not as accurate as experiments\n",
    "    - outside factors not included (ex: in rolling dice simulation gravity and air resistance)\n",
    "- When do you <u>not</u> use a simulation?\n",
    "    - when a situation already has set results/data (won't change) \n",
    "    - examples: a score in a game, most purchased food, average yearly wage"
