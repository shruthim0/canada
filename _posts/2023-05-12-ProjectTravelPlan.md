# First Week
- In the first week we hope to create the repository and work on the CSS and overall aesthetic of the website
- We will add the map of the possible travel plans that students may have
- Research all the different APIs/ information of transportation to different cities

# Second Week
- We will start adding different elements of travel through lists and dictionaries
    - Distance from hometown to school
    - Preferred mode of transportation
    - Transportation pricing
- This will benefit the search feature and the input for where the user is planning to travel to for school, and help the user decide which travel route is the best for them
- We may also start adding the colleges to the map a functions to the map such as displaying different routes of travel to a city, and when the route is clicked on, it will show the user how long the travel will take and how much it will cost
- We will start coding the search feature

# Third Week
- We will finish our map feature by adding all the travel routes of each city and allowing the user to click those colleges and learn information about them
- We will wrap up our search feature by having it display all of the possible routes with keys that the user input
- We will clean up our UI if there are any problems.
- We will also finish our travel feature by having it display all of the travel routes that match what the user inputed is their intrest.
