# Simulations Lesson Outline


## What is a Simulation + Vocabulary
- Objectives
1. Understand how computers can be used to represent real-world phenomena or outcomes
2. Compare simulations with real-world contexts.
3. Implement code to mimic real world situations, problems, or phenomena.

- Simulations are abstractions that mimic more __________ or ________ from the real world
    - Purposes include drawing ________ without the contraints of the real world
- Simulations use varying sets of values to reflect the ___________ state of a real phenomenon
- Often, when developing a simulation, it is necessary to _________ specific details or __________ aspects
    - Simulations can often contain ______ based on which details or real-world elements were included/excluded
- Simulations allow the formulation of hypotheses under consideration
- Variability and randomness of the world is considered using random number generators
- Examples: rolling dice, spinners, molecular models, analyze chemicals/reactions...

- Have people fill in the blanks^
